# project-trivia-game

trivia API/jQuery game

This game can have an many players as one would like and as many questions as one would like.

The question set is only sport, mulitple choice questions right now. welcome to answer any question in any order! no time limit.

The game is not pretty, I was going for funcionality over prettyness here...even though functionality isn't all the best either...

the game is designed to not show what question is right or wrong until the results page is pressed (still have to make). This is the reason I saved the questions, answers, and correct answers for each player to created another div with each person's questions, what they answered and the correct answer.
